# CORLD
Containing MATLAB and Verilog files of CORLD correlator and decorrelator
Inside MATLAB files the controlling parameters are provided to easily adapt based on user's requirements.
Verilog files are designed to be sythensized by DC. 

Reffering to the paper published in ICCAD 2021, "CORLD: In-Stream Correlation Manipulation forLow-Discrepancy Stochastic Computing", the MATLAB files simulate the correlator and decorrelator techniques proposed in the paper and Verilog files are responsible for hardware implementations of the mentioned methods.

Hope they will help out SC community.
