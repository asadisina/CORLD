# CORLD
This repository is created for the paper entitled "CORLD: In-Stream Correlation Manipulation for Low-Discrepancy Stochastic Computing" published in ICCAD 2021. Inside this project, all codes are provided for assisting future co-workers working on Stochastic Computing (SC), particularly for those who are interested in correlation and decorrelation techniques used in bit-streams (most likely in stream based). 
Containing MATLAB and Verilog files of CORLD correlator and decorrelator
Inside MATLAB files the controlling parameters are provided to easily adapt based on user's requirements.
Verilog files are designed to be sythensized by DC. 
The MATLAB files simulate the correlator and decorrelator techniques proposed in the paper and Verilog files are responsible for hardware implementations of the mentioned methods.

Hope they will help our SC community and to expand the utilization of SC.
