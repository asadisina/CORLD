# CORLD
This repository is created for the paper entitled "CORLD: In-Stream Correlation Manipulation for Low-Discrepancy Stochastic Computing" published in ICCAD 2021. Inside this project, all codes are provided for assisting future co-workers working on Stochastic Computing (SC), particularly for those who are interested in correlation and decorrelation techniques used in bit-streams (most likely in stream based). 
Containing MATLAB and Verilog files of CORLD correlator and decorrelator
Inside MATLAB files the controlling parameters are provided to easily adapt based on user's requirements.
Verilog files are designed to be sythensized by DC. 

## Requirements
- MATLAB (for .m files, which are created to run and test the performance of the proposed approaches)
- Modelsim (for running and verifying verilog codes)
- Design Compiler (for sythesizing the hardware implementations to obtain different parameters)

## MATLAB Codes
The MATLAB files simulate the correlator and decorrelator techniques proposed in the paper. 
Both codes consist conrol parameter panel, and the parameter are defined as follows:
### Correlator
- n : shows the bit-width of the system
- k : determines the number of cycles or length of bit-streams
- input-mode : There are defined three types of input bit-streams, Sobol-based and FSM-based [[1]](#1) both for determinstic techniques, LFSR-based for non-determinstic (conventional) approach.  
- 
 
## Verilog Codes
Verilog files are responsible for hardware implementations of the mentioned methods.
